xbmc-random-tv
==============

XBMC script for picking random TV Shows from your library

User will be prompted for three things before a show is chosen:

* Unwatched/Watched shows only
* Genre of show (if any)
* Which show they want to watch (if any)

The user can hide these prompts if they wish and also give a default value to watched/unwatched.
This way they can always get either watched/unwatched shows without being prompted every time they use the plugin.
User can also turn of the prompts for Genre and Show - this will default to the same as them selecting "No" if the prompt
was given.
