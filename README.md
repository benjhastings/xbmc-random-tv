#xbmc-random-tv#

###Why I wrote it###

I got bored of trying to decide which TV Show I wanted to watch so decided that letting XBMC pick for me would be much better!

This borrows heavily from the excellent [XBMC Random Movies](https://github.com/elParaguayo/xbmc-random-movies)
by elParaguayo


###Usage###

* Download the repository as a ZIP file extract the "script.randomtv" folder to your profiles addons folder.

* You will be asked the following questions
  * Watched Status (Should the addon only pick from Watched/Unwatched episodes)
  * Genre (Should the addon only pick from a specific genre)
  * Show (Should the addon only pick from a specific show)
* Defaults for all these options can be set in the addons settings.
